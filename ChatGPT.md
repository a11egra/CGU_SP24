>what's wrong here? full_query is a pandas dataframe: 

```
qSAH = full_query.groupby(full_query['Program 1 Category'] == 'SAH')

qSAH.info()
qSAH
```

>It seems like you're trying to group your DataFrame full_query by a condition on the column 'Program 1 Category' being equal to 'SAH'. However, the syntax you've used might not work as expected.

>Here's how you can fix it:

```
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'Program 1 Category' is a column in your DataFrame full_query

# Grouping by the condition 'Program 1 Category' == 'SAH'
qSAH = full_query.groupby(full_query['Program 1 Category'] == 'SAH')

# If you want to get the count of rows in each group:
qSAH_info = qSAH.size()

# If you want to see the information of the grouped DataFrame:
print(qSAH_info)

# To see the grouped DataFrame itself, you can iterate through it or access individual groups:
for group_name, group_df in qSAH:
    print("Group:", group_name)
    print(group_df)
```

>In this code:

>`full_query.groupby(full_query['Program 1 Category'] == 'SAH')` groups the DataFrame `full_query` by the condition specified inside the groupby function.
`qSAH_info` contains the count of rows in each group.

>Printing `qSAH_info` will give you information about the size of each group.
You can iterate through the `qSAH` object to access individual groups and their corresponding DataFrames.

>i want qSAH to be a new, complete dataframe

ChatGPT
>To create a new DataFrame containing only the rows where the value in the 'Program 1 Category' column is 'SAH', you can filter `full_query` using the condition and assign the result to `qSAH`. Here's how you can do it:

```
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'Program 1 Category' is a column in your DataFrame full_query

# Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where 'Program 1 Category' is 'SAH'
qSAH = full_query[full_query['Program 1 Category'] == 'SAH']

# Now qSAH is a new DataFrame containing only rows where 'Program 1 Category' is 'SAH'

```

>In this code:

>`full_query[full_query['Program 1 Category'] == 'SAH']` filters full_query to include only the rows where the value in the 'Program 1 Category' column is 'SAH'.
>The result is assigned to `qSAH`, which becomes a new DataFrame containing only the rows where 'Program 1 Category'  is 'SAH'.
