# CGU_SP24
Final Project for IST 341 at Claremont Graduate University, Spring 2024.

## up next...
*   How can I see what features are more or less likely to lead to an enroll? 
*   Can I export these feature importances to a pandas dataframe (and/or CSV)?
*   Is there a cool way to graph this using seaborn?
